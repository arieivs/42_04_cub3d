## ‚öôÔ∏è‚Äã Setup - Minilibx
For reference, here's [hsmit's guide](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) and [gontjarow's guide](https://gontjarow.github.io/MiniLibX/) to minilibx.

On your Makefile, check in which OS your programme is being compiled by doing
```
UNAME = $(shell uname)
ifeq ($(UNAME), Darwin)
	# we're in a Mac
ifeq ($(UNAME), Linux)
	# we're using Linux
endif
```

### üêß‚Äã Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
```
On your Makefile, after compiling minilibx, compile your project with the static library ```libmlx.a``` and the additional grapfical libraries ```-lXext -lX11 -lm -lz```.

### üçè‚Äã Apple
Download the minilibx_mms provided on intra.
On your Makefile, after compiling minilibx, copy the dynamic library ```libmlx.dylib``` to your root repository, to facilitate its usage.

## Raycasting
[Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

### Intro
Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen.

### Raycasting Basics
The basic idea is that the map is a 2d grid, with each square being either 0 or 1 (wall or no wall).

### Vectors Recap
Vectors are abstract notions but always have 2 essential components:
1. A direction in space
2. A magnitude or length

Vector in 2D euclidian space:

`v = 
[ vx 
  vy ]`

In computer graphics we can easily represent the above as a 2-element array of floating point numbers or a struct containing 2 floats. In 2D, we can say the direction of the vector is equal to `m = vy / vx`. This expresses the change in vertical position per unit of horizontal position x.

Vector magnitude (also called the norm) is represented by the formula `sqrt(vx^2 + vy^2)`

## Basics of working with MINILIBX
MiniLibx is a tiny graphics library written for UNIX. It allows us to render pixels to a window. We will not discuss set-up here as it is well explained at [42 Docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html). However we would like to add some clarification to this guide on how to use MiniLibx.

### Establishing connection to the library
To initialize minilibx, there are 3 steps to follow:

1. Initialize the graphical connection to the library
	- `void *mlx_init(void)`
2. Create a new window using the graphical connection
	- `void *mlx_new_window(void *mlx, int width, int height, char *title);`
3. Set-up an image buffer
	- The image needs an image pointer to draw to as well as several data points:
		- image pointer
		-
		- bits per pixel
		- line_length
		- endian
	-

We must first initialize the connection to the library, using a void pointer `void *mlx` and also a pointer to the window generated by minilibx in `void *mlx_win`. Next, it is most useful to draw first to a buffered image `t_data img`, rather than directly to the window, as this will cause screentearing.

Once the image has been drawn, we can safely put it inside of the window. Below code sample shows a minimal setup of minilibx inside of a main:

```
#include "mlx.h"

int main(void)
{
	void	*mlx;
	void	*mlx_win;
	t_data	img;

	mlx = mlx_init();
	mlx_win = mlx_new_window(mlx, 640, 480, "Readme");

	img.img = mlx_new_image(mlx, 640, 480) // creates a new image in memory. We can draw inside of this image
	img.addr = mlx_get_data_addr(img.img, &img.bits_per_pixel, &img.line_length, &img.endian);

	// Let's now try and put some pixels down in a loop using our pixel_put function
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		my_mlx_pixel_put(&img, 5 + i, 5, 0x00FF0000);
	mlx_put_image_to_window(mlx, mlx_win, img.img, 0, 0);
	mlx_loop(mlx);
}
```


```
#include <mlx.h> // Necessary header defined inside of the minilibx-linux folder

// Struct in which we define several important data items:
typedef struct	s_data {
	void	*img;			// pointer to the image which we will layer on top of the screen
	char	*addr;			// returns info about the image, allowing us to modify it later.
	int		bits_per_pixel;	// will be set by MiniLibx
	int		line_length;	// will be set by MiniLibx
	int		endian;			// will be set by MiniLibx
}				t_data;

int main(void)
{
	void	*mlx;
	void	*mlx_win;
	t_data	img;

	mlx = mlx_init(); // Establishes the connection to the graphical system and stores it
	mlx_win = mlx_new_window(mlx, 640, 480, "Readme") // Provide dimensions for the screen and a name

	img.img = mlx_new_image(mlx, 640, 480) // creates a new image in memory. We can draw inside of this image
	img.addr = mlx_get_data_addr(img.img, &img.bits_per_pixel, &img.line_length, &img.endian);

	// Let's now try and put some pixels down in a loop using our pixel_put function
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		my_mlx_pixel_put(&img, 5 + i, 5, 0x00FF0000);
	mlx_put_image_to_window(mlx, mlx_win, img.img, 0, 0);
	mlx_loop(mlx);
}
```
